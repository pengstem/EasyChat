## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google API key (obtainable from <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>)
- Internet connection

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EasyChat.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd EasyChat

# Install required packages
pip install google-generativeai websockets websockets-proxy rich elevenlabs pyaudio
```

## 🔑 API Key Setup (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

For security and convenience, it's strongly recommended to add your Google API key as an environment variable:

### Windows

```cmd
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
```

*Note: You'll need to restart your command prompt or IDE after setting this.*

### macOS/Linux

```bash
echo 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

*For zsh users, use `~/.zshrc` instead.*

This approach:

- Keeps your API key secure (not exposed in code)
- Makes the application work seamlessly across sessions
- Prevents accidental sharing of your key in version control

After setting the environment variable, the application will automatically detect and use it without prompting.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python gemini.py
```
